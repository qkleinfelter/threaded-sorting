# Threaded-Sorting
Linux program that uses Posix style pthreads, as well as the quicksort and shellsort algorithms to handle sorting a large array that it creates and randomizes.

## Usage
Compile the program by running `gcc -g -pthread project2.c -o project2`, or by running the included `./test.sh` which will compile and run several test cases for you, I prefer to run this with `./test.sh > results.txt` so that my terminal isn't cluttered.
